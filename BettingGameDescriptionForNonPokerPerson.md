## Game Procedure:
players bet on strength of their hand, if they agree on same amount of bet, they go to showdown, which they show 
their hand and the stronger(higher) hand will win the all the money. 

#### Dealing Hands(or Cards):
Each player is dealt a **'hand'** from the **'deck'** with specified given **'distribution'** which is usually uniform. 
Players deck might be different.

#### Putting the antes in the pot and start of betting:
Each player put 1 **'chip'** in the **'pot'**, which is unit of money in the game. This forced bet, which is called 
'ante' is actually what the whole fight is for. Then betting starts:
At each **'decision point'**, each player, in his turn, could accept the amount of bet by other player so far, could bet
more, or could choose to not bet any more money. 
First **'op'** decide weather he want to bet or not
then **'ip'** decides. So each player gets at least one chance to bet more money, After this, at any point, if both 
player have same amount of money in the pot, the betting stops.  Also total number of bets should never exceed max 
number of bets of game. 
More specifically, each player has some of following options for his decision, which we call it action:

#### Player Actions:
**'fold'**: which means surrendering and forfeiting all the money that he has put in the **'pot'** so far.
**'check**
**'call'**: which means agreeing to the bet,and putting as much money as his opponent.
**'bet'**: which means bet money
**'raise'**: which means betting more money than the amount that opponent has bet. Basically a raise can be seen as a 
    call and then a extra bet after the call.

#### Showdown:
Player with higher hand will win all the money in the pot
